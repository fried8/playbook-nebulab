title: Onboarding
meta_description: >
  Over the years, we have established a set of principles that supercharge our development process.
  Read on to find what they are and how we implement them!

The onboarding process consists of six different steps:

1. **Kick-off call:** During this call we will get to know each other. We will introduce ourselves,
   our tools and our practices. We will also ask you to explain your project's goals and current
   work methodology (if any) and what you expect from us.
2. **Project evaluation:** After the kick-off call, we will ask for access to anything that might
   help us figure out whether we're a good fit for each other. Depending on the stage of your
   project, this might be a specification document or your existing codebase.
3. **Negotiation and contract:** If we determine that we can provide value to your project, we will
   send you an overview of the resources we expect will be needed to accomplish the required goals,
   along with their cost. If everything looks good to you, we will then send a contract to sign.
   [Here's a sample contract](/middleman/uploads/contract-draft.pdf).
4. **Tool onboarding:** Once the contract is signed, we will ask you to provide access to all the
   tools we will use to work on your project. Typically, these include tools such as Slack, GitHub
   and anything else you use to organize your work.
5. **Team meeting:** At this point, we will set up a meeting with your new team and ask you to bring
   any members of your team that will frequently interact with the developers. You will get to know
   your new team will get to know each other and make sure there are no blockers to starting the
   work.
6. **Development kick-off:** Once we are all set, we will start working on your project!
