## The "Team Leads" Team

> Leaders who are strong team players understand that the people who report to
> them are not their first team. Instead, their first team is their peers across
> the company. This first-team focus helps them make decisions that consider the
> needs of the company as a whole before focusing on the needs of their team.

*Camille Fournier. “The Manager's Path”.*

While the life as an engineer is deeply rooted in getting feedback from your peers,
being a team lead you'll risk feeling a sense of loneliness. The peer-level meeting
will act as a support group in which you can share your management problems and gather
feedback on the solutions you're planning to employ. In such a setting, any
recurring solutions or problems will also have a chance of being recognized as a
pattern and addressed as a company.

It will also increase your sense of belonging to the "team leads" team, knowing each
other better, both personally and professionally. Giving everyone better insight
into other teams it creates a fertile ground for shared, bottom-up, solutions.

## Template

The meeting usually lasts from half an hour to a hour, and is held weekly.
The agenda is not set, but anyone can bring up a topic, these usually include:

- a current challenge faced by a team;
- a request for more insight on how another team solves a particular problem;
- brainstorming on how to improve the process or which tool to adopt.

A journal is then updated by one of the team leads reporting the date, participants, and
the main topics or solutions that were discussed.
